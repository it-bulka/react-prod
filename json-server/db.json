            "There are also other ways to run JS code in a browser. Typically, JavaScript programs are loaded into the browser to make web pages work. Usually, the code is formatted as separate .js files that are linked to web pages, but the code can also be included directly in the page's code. This is done using the <script> tag. When the browser detects this code, it executes it. More details about the script tag can be found on w3school.com.

You can run this example using the resources of this site (look for the Try it Yourself button), but we will do things a little differently. Namely, we will create a new file called hello.html in a text editor (for example, VS Code or Notepad++) and add the following code to it:"
